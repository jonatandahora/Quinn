A simple XML parser in Elixir aims to parse rss/atom feeds. I'm currently
using `xmerl_scan.string` to parse the xml. I'm a bit busy so I may take awhile to response and/or update. Feel free to send a pull request. Otherwise, check out [hex](https://hex.pm/packages?search=xml&sort=downloads) for other XML parsers that may be better maintained.

Note: I am not parsing comment at the moment. It does handle comment, but it just ignores it. Hopefully I will update it soon. Sorry!

# Parsing


```elixir
Quinn.parse("<head><title short_name = \"yah\">Yahoo</title><title:content>Bing</title:content></head>")
```
Calling parse on the xml will produce
```elixir
[%{attr: [], name: :head,
   value: [%{attr: [short_name: "yah"], name: :title, value: ["Yahoo"]},
           %{attr: [], name: :"title:content", value: ["Bing"]}]}]
```
# Finding nodes

Suppose you want to find all the body nodes from this structure:
```elixir
structure = %{attr: [],
              name: :html,
              value: [%{attr: [], name: :head, value: ["title"]},
                      %{attr: [], name: :title, value: []},
                      %{attr: [], name: :body, value: ["body1", "body2"]},
                      %{attr: [], name: :footer, value: [%{attr: [], name: :line, value: ["this"]}]},
                      %{attr: [], name: :body, value: [%{attr: [], name: :line, value: ["that"]}]},
                      %{attr: [], name: :"content:encoded", value: ["<p>comet!!</p>"]}]}
```
You can call
```elixir
Quinn.find(structure, :body)
```
This will be the result:
```elixir
[%{attr: [], name: :body, value: ["body1", "body2"]},
 %{attr: [], name: :body, value: [%{attr: [], name: :line, value: ["that"]}]}]
```
Or given the structure above, you want to find the node `line` inside `body`, then you can invoke it like this:
```elixir
Quinn.find(structure, [:body, :line])
```
The result will be
```elixir
[%{attr: [], name: :line, value: ["that"]}]
```
Please refer to the tests if you want to see more example on how it is used.

Please let me know if you come across any problem. I'm still new to Elixir so feel free to contribute or clean up the code.
